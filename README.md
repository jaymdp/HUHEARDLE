# HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD HEARDLE (github edition)

A clone of Joywave Heardle which was itself a clone of [Heardle](https://www.heardle.app/). I'd also like to thank the person that re-wrote the original CHVRCHES Heardle to fix the issue of Heardle not looping when all the songs have been played. They unfortunately deleted their Reddit account so I can't properly credit them, but this Heardle wouldn't still be running if not for them <3.

Originally hosted on Glitch, but with the removal of webhosting I am now working on moving it because. I miss it!! Ok!!

Heardle is a song-based game in which every IRL day a new song is generated and the player is given a snippet of the song in order to guess the name of it!
This Heardle uses songs specifically from Hollywood Undead's discography using Soundcloud.

You can feel free to download/edit/frankenstein this code however much you want. I don't really know what I'm doing half the time and don't claim responsibility if everything breaks and explodes
