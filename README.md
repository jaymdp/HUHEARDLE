# HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD HEARDLE

A clone of Joywave Heardle which was itself a clone of [Heardle](https://www.heardle.app/). I'd also like to thank the person that re-wrote the original CHVRCHES Heardle to fix the issue of Heardle not looping when all the songs have been played. They unfortunately deleted their Reddit account so I can't properly credit them, but this Heardle wouldn't still be running if not for them <3.

You can feel free to download/edit/frankenstein this code however much you want. I don't really know what I'm doing half the time and don't claim responsibility if everything breaks and explodes

<h2>How To Play</h2>
Heardle is a song-based game in which every IRL day a new song is generated and the player is given a snippet of the song in order to guess the name of it! When you have a guess, you can type the name of the song into the search bar and select the option that appears. You have six chances to answer correctly and each wrong attempt rewards you with another second of the song.

If the player doesn't load after refreshing, it's normally an issue caused on Soundcloud's end. It should sort itself out after awhile. The player also has issues playing on mobile devices using the Opera GX browser and I have yet to figure out why, but the site should run fine on other browsers.
